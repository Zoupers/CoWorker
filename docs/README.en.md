# Coworker Documentation

[中文](README.md) · English

[← Back to project home](../README.en.md)

This documentation covers operation, configuration, communication surfaces, product clients, internal architecture, and development. Pages are grouped by functional domain; each directory has its own index so future additions do not turn the `docs/` root into an unstructured list.

## Directory conventions

- Chinese pages use `<name>.md`; English pages use `<name>.en.md`.
- Domain indexes use `README.md` and `README.en.md`.
- User-facing guidance belongs to its functional domain. Cross-component proposals belong to the most relevant domain and identify themselves as a design or proposal in the title.
- Shared static assets remain under [`assets/`](assets/).
